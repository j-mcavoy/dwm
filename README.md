# dwm fork
This is my fork of [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org/) that I use for my personal
display manager.

## What is dwm
dwm is a minimal X display manager which is differs from other
Linux display managers in that it is configured via applying your own patch to
its base source code and compiling the window manager yourself.

## What does my patch add
My patch of dwm adds custom key bindings, default applications, and styling to
based on my personal workflow.
